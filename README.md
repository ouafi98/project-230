video demonstrating the solution can be found here https://youtu.be/S1a9L4clW38

Need at least Matlab R2021a to work, sorry for the older releases.

PS: the solution here is functional but the simulink need to be clean a bit.

The solution is composed of a quaternion-based state estimator [1] and the controller used is described in [2] & [3].
